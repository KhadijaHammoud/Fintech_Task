A simple application that allows users to create loan smart objects by filling in the form with the loan amount, borrower and lender. 

All fields must be filled in in order to create a loan object, and the Amount field can only take a number. 

All loans created are shown in a table. The screen refreshes after every couple of seconds to keep the table up to date. After creating a loan, it will take a couple of seconds for it to appear on the table.
